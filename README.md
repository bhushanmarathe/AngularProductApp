# ProductApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.6.

---

## Running the Application Locally

### Prerequisites
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or later recommended)
- (Optional) Install Angular CLI globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @angular/cli

Steps to Run the Application
1) Clone the repository: git clone your-repo-url  cd your-project-folder
2) Install dependencies: npm install

Notes:
1) Product data is loaded asynchronously from a local JSON file located at src/assets/products.json.

2) Tailwind CSS is used for styling and is built automatically during the development server run.

3) The application uses Angular 16 standalone components and modern dependency injection patterns.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
